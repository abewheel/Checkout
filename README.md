## Description


Checkout is an autonomous checkout system and consolidated shopping resource application. It incorporates all the shopping necessities into a single smartphone app. It has it all: shopping lists, coupons, store directories, and, best of all, it allows customers to complete their purchases without ever having to wait in line.

## About the Project


This repository contains the Android source code for Checkout. I wrote Checkout in 2017. It provides real offered prices for scanned items found online, though is intended to ultimately be connected to a POS system for vendor-specific prices.

## Technical Details


Checkout was implemented in Java using AndroidStudio. It utilizes Amazon Cognito, DynamoDB NoSQL database, Amazon Pinpoint, and the Google Vision API. It uses an MVC design pattern with Singleton data persistence. It uses Volley for networking and UPCitemDB for UPC-A compliant barcode lookups.
